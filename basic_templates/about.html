      <h4>GLE’s mission is to expand cross-cultural exchange’s, primarily between the population of China and the outside the world. The relationship between China and other nations is becoming more complicated and dynamic as globalization increases. The primary way that people from different nations interact is through travel and education. Since 2012, GLE, under the umbrella of East-West Education LLC has helped more than 1000 people from 12 countries secure great teaching opportunities throughout China, primarily in the capital city of Beijing. While the majority of our team members are native English speakers, we also have opportunities for non-native English speakers. Available positions are primarily both private and public kindergartens, middle schools, high schools, universities, and language training centers. We evaluate ALL applicants on their backgrounds and merits and work to find the best possible position that ensures a stable and comfortable working and living environment in China. Since 2015, we have had a specialized, bilateral program that aims to open doors in the U.S.A to Chinese students through summer travel programs and full-time school placement. </h4>

      <div class="welcome-left">
        <p>GLE strives to make your transition to China very easy as a majority of our teachers have never lived or worked in China before. Upon arrival in China, you’ll be picked up from the airport by a staff member and immediately receive temporary housing. Depending on when you arrive, you’ll go through a vigorous orientation with the many other new team members. This is a unique and terrific opportunity to make friends immediately. You will also receive a crash-course in what it’s like to TEFL, work in your school and instructed on what is expected of you as a full-time teacher. You’ll also be given valuable information and tips on daily life in China. We aim for all newly arrived teachers to begin working full-time within one week of arrival. Once placed in your school, you will move into to your permanent apartment and be provided with a Chinese Assistant. Our assistants are here to help orientate you and make sure that you can handle the many different situations that will arise when living in an unfamiliar country. Through a step by step process, we aim to alleviate some of the culture shock that typically comes with living in China. Examples may include introducing teachers to the staff of their new school and showing the route to their school. They'll help you open a bank account, buy a phone and complete your police residency registration. You may need linens or other houseware items. The primarily role of our support staff is to make sure that you are able to live and work in China independently.</p>
        <p>There is definitely a language barrier that exists between Chinese people and expats but you will have help with translation services both inside and outside of your school. We really do our best to make the transition as painless as possible, all that we ask for is patience and a positive attitude. In any situation where a teacher is reasonably in need, you will have a strong support system to lean on, something that is incredibly important for both new and seasoned expats. What sets GLE apart from nearly every other TEFL recruiting service is our ability to truly understand the needs and desires of our teachers as we have both a Chinese and American staff who work day and night to make sure that you are enjoying your time in China. We are eager to put you in contact with former and current teachers who are more than willing to share their experiences with you.</p>
