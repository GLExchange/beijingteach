        <p>At GLE, foreign teachers who accept a contract that includes free housing are provided with comfortable housing very close to the school where they work. Apartments are clean, fully-furnished, and modern. Units include one or more bedrooms, comfortable living space, and a kitchen. Amenities include a refrigerator, a washing machine, A/C and heating, TV, and high-speed cable and Internet connections. Some living spaces are shared with another foreign teacher, while others receive individual housing; please let us know of your preference. The majority of the apartments are shared. We aim to make your time in China as easy and comfortable as possible. Imagine the ease and security of being able to move into your apartment as soon as you have completed training, hitting the ground running right away. Rent in Beijing can average between 3,000 RMB â€“ 6,000 RMB+. In smaller cities, rent is much cheaper but also with less amenities. You will be able to live rent-free in a spacious, comfortable apartment with the ability to save money while at the same time enjoying a very high standard of living.</p>
