        <p>GLE is partnered 20+ educational institutions in China, with a focus on Beijing that offer English as a Second Language (ESL) programs. We only consider positions in progressive schools with modern classroom facilities and a commitment to providing a quality learning environment. All schools are fully vetted by our team. Typically, all first-time teachers work in kindergartens or language centers. About 60% of our team members are new to China and teaching overall. Only with two full years of teaching experience and a bachelor’s degree will you qualify to work with older students. While teaching positions are available for all grade and age levels, current demand in China is greatest for kindergarten and early childhood development. Please let us know if you have a strong preference for working with older students, and we will try our best to accommodate you.</p>
        <p>Teaching English as a second language (TESL, TEFL, TESOL) is one of the most unique life experiences a person can have. Every day is an adventure and never boring. A common saying among our teachers, "There's never a dull day living and working in China.” If working in a kindergarten, you might have a number of students who speak basic English and know lots of vocabulary, they can genuinely communicate with you. The opposite may also exist, you might be the first foreigner some of your children have ever seen, let alone spoken to. They might be scared and shy at first but you'll be amazed at how quickly that will change. Working with kids is simple; at the end of the day, you just need to put a smile on their face and rest will follow from there.  While in the classroom, there will always be Chinese teaching assistants there to help bridge the language gap and help you effectively interact with your kids. It’s much more exciting than overwhelming - but what great job shouldn't be? It can definitely be challenging at times, but working with these kids on a daily basis and helping them learn the important and valuable skill of speaking English is a life enriching experience that will undoubtedly have a very strong impact on your life. You may even have the honor of giving your students English names.</p>
        <p>Like any other kids, sometimes they might drive you crazy, but at the end of the day, this is a rewarding and fascinating experience, being able to give impressionable children the gift of language. You might ask yourself, how am I going to teach English to little kids who don't speak one word - the answer is just to make them laugh and smile, tickle them and you’ve won. Both the kids and their families will form very strong relationships with you that will make an impact on your life as well as theirs. When they learn new words and phrases and make small steps of progress, both they and you will experience a genuine feeling of accomplishment. There's a reason that people say kids are like sponges, they really do soak in everything you say and do. It's amazing how quickly children can pick up words and phrases, you can teach them to use western slang that you use with your friends from home (please nothing dirty). You will definitely find yourself learning little phrases of Chinese from them as well. They learn from you but you can also learn a lot from them. That is the true goal of GLE. </p>
        <p>In the classroom, the class size and the age of students will vary and will certainly affect how you go about getting the kids engaged with the lesson. Children have short attention spans and it really comes down keeping the students excited, interested, and engaged. Many of your lessons will be experimental to see what does or doesn't work. The most important thing to remember is to just have fun with it and keep the classroom environment loose and unconventional. If you're smiling and enjoying yourself, all you need to do is look around and most of the kids will be on the same page. The kids almost always grow to love foreign teachers with mind-blowing speed. </p>
        <p>Class sizes vary and typically include 10 to 20 students. All classrooms include at least one Chinese assistant who can help with lesson planning, translation, and general classroom management. Your primary responsibilities will include instructing students in basic English vocabulary, proper pronunciation, and sentence structure through lessons, songs and activities. You will be trained on how to conduct brief, effective, daily English lessons that focus on these areas.</p>
        <p>Typically, teachers will have multiple classes throughout the day, each lasting between 15 and 30 minutes. Some schools, including most international schools, require teachers to remain in the same class for a full or half-day. In such cases, you will teach English to the class during allotted times. When not conducting class, teachers talk with the students and participate in all school activities. Depending on the school, teachers have between 1 ½ and 3 hours for lunch. </p>
