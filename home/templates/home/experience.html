                    <p>Working with children and teaching them English as second language is one of the most unique life experiences a person can have. Everyday is an adventure and never boring. A common saying among our teachers, "There's never a dull day living and working in China as an English teacher." In your kindergarten, you might have a number of students who speak Basic English and know lots of vocabulary. On the flip side, you might be the first foreigner some of your children have ever seen, let alone spoken to. They might be terrified of you at first and very shy but you'll be amazed at how quickly that will change. Working with kids is simple - At the end of the day, you just need to put a smile on their face and rest will follow from there. While in the classroom, there will Chinese teaching assistants there to help bridge the language gap and help you communicate more with your kids. It’s much more exciting than overwhelming - but what great job shouldn't be? It can definitely be challenging at times, but working with these kids on a daily basis and helping them learn the important and valuable skill of speaking English is a life enriching experience that will be part of your for the rest of your life. You may even have the honor of giving your students English names.</p>
                    <p>Like any other kids, sometimes they might drive you crazy, but at the end of the day it is a rewarding and fascinating experience, being able to give impressionable children the gift of language. You might ask yourself, how am I going to teach English to little kids who don't speak one word - the answer is just to make them laugh and smile. They'll form very strong attachments to you that will make an impact on your life as well as theirs. When they learn new words and phrases and make small steps of progress, both you and them will experience a genuine feeling of accomplishment. There's a reason that people say kids are like sponges, they really do soak in everything you say and do. It's amazing how quickly children can pick up words and phrases, you can teach them to use western slang that you use with your friends from home. You will definitely find yourself learning little phrases of Chinese from them as well. They learn from you but you can also learn a lot from them. In the classroom, the class size and the age of students will vary and will certainly affect how you go about getting the kids engaged with the lesson. Children have short attention spans and it really comes down keeping the students excited, interested, and engaged. Many of your lessons will be experimental to see what does or doesn't work. Kids are easy to please and they love songs, games, and just keeping the energy level high. The most important thing to remember is to just have fun with it and keep the classroom environment loose and unconventional. If you're smiling and enjoying yourself, all you need to do is look around and most of the kids will be on the same page. The kids always grow to love foreign teachers with mind-blowing speed, and they will certainly love you before you know it.</p>
                    <p>BeijingTeach works with Beijing-area schools that offer English as a Second Language Programs. We only consider positions in progressive schools with modern classroom facilities and a commitment to providing a quality learning environment. Class sizes vary and typically include 10 to 20 students. All classrooms include at least one Chinese assistant who can help with lesson planning, translation, and general classroom management. Your primary responsibilities will include instructing students in basic English vocabulary, proper pronunciation, and sentence structure through lessons, songs and activities. You will be trained on how to conduct brief, effective, daily English lessons that focus on these areas.</p>
                    <p>Typically, teachers will have multiple classes throughout the day, each lasting between 15 and 30 minutes. Some schools, including most international schools, require teachers to remain in the same class for a full or half-day. In such cases, you will teach English to the class during allotted times. When not conducting class, teachers talk with the students and participate in outdoor activities. Depending on the school, teachers have between 1 ½ and 3 hours for lunch. While teaching positions are available for all grade levels, including university positions, current demand in China is greatest for kindergarten and early childhood development. Please let us know if you have a strong preference for working with older students, and we will try our best to accommodate you.</p>
