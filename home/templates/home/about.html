                <p>We make your transition to China very easy. You will be picked up from the airport upon your arrival in China and you will receive temporary housing with many other new teachers where you'll go through an orientation on life in China. You will also receive a crash-course in TEFL, living in China and be instructed in the the best ways to approach your new job. Once placed in a school, you will move into to your new apartment and be provided with a Chinese Assistant. Our Assistants are here to help you with the many different situations that will arise when living in an unfamiliar country and to alleviate some of the culture shock that comes with living in China. Examples include introducing teachers to the staff of their new schools and showing the route to their school. They'll help you open a bank account and complete your police registration (In Beijing all residents have to register their address with the police department). There is definitely a language barrier that exists between Chinese people and expats but you will have help with translation services both inside and outside of your school. As a person coming to China for the first time, we really do our best to make the transition as painless for you as possible and alleviate some of the culture shock that comes with living in an unfamiliar land. In any situation where a teacher is reasonably in need, you will have a strong support system to lean on. What sets BeijingTeach apart from nearly every other recruiting service you'll encounter is that we genuinely care about our teachers. Our staff consists of Americans and Chinese nationals who work day and night to make sure that you are enjoying your time in the capital city of China. We are happy to put you in contact with former and current teachers who are more than willing to share their experiences with you.​​​​</p>
